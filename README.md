## Creating a Release

:information_source: _Please ensure `ko` is installed according to the [TriggerMesh Contributor Guide][tm-contrib-ko]._

To publish a container image for this bundle and generate the corresponding release manifests, set the value of the
`KO_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable to the container registry where the image is to be pushed, then run:

```
make release
```

Once the build is complete and the container image is uploaded, the release manifests are written to the `_output`
directory.

```console
$ ls _output
triggermesh-crds.yaml  triggermesh.yaml
```
